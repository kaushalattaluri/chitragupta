# Python Interface - PySide2/PyQt5(optional) (MODERN / FLAT GUI)

Donated to Karunya Sindhu Orphanage for managing their accounts.

Project created using Python, Qt Designer and PySide2.
I hope it helps everyone who is starting now in the Python world.
This project works very well with Windows and Linux (Font issue observed in Linux)

# REQUERIMENTS:
> ```sh
> pip install pyside2==5.15.2
> ```
> PySide2 and PyQt5 in version 5.15.1 **are causing problems** due to several updates in process.
